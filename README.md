# Escape Cave
My first programs from **04/2021**:  
A puzzle 2D Platformer Game and its linked Website.
# ðŸŒ• â€¢ Website

## Why this project?
After high school, in **2021**, I had to use Parcoursup to find a higher education institution for computer science. However, my application was really poor: gap year & absences in high school (Aside from the social aspect, it didn't interest me, I was bored), I thought I would code a video game and its website to put it on my cover letter.

## How to Play it
(only Windows is supported)
- Download EscapeCave.zip from the website or from the repo
- Extract it
- Run EscapeCave.exe
